# 🧾 Bincom Assignment 2 – To-Do List App

A simple and responsive **To-Do List App** built with **HTML and CSS only**.  
This project demonstrates understanding of the **HTML structure**, **CSS Box Model**, and **hover effects**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This app displays a list of tasks styled with modern CSS.  
It uses an unordered list (`<ul>` and `<li>`) to organize tasks and applies the Box Model (padding, border, and margin) to structure the layout.

Each list item represents a task and changes its appearance when hovered, creating a clean and interactive user experience — all without JavaScript.
